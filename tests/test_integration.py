Integration Tests - End-to-end testing with mock bot server.
Tests Phase 3 (Simulator), Phase 4 (Judges), Phase 5 (Reports), Phase 6 (Orchestrator).

These tests use the mock bot server for deterministic, free testing.

Run: pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
Note: Start mock bot first: python -m tests.mock_bot_server &
